This documentation outlines the overall process of an AWS Step Function workflow that efficiently orchestrates the execution of three AWS Lambda functions. Unlike the previous version, this workflow utilizes Docker containers to package the Lambda functions, which are then pushed to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). These containers are used to create individual Lambda functions, which are then integrated into the Step Function workflow.
